Building and Monitoring a KubeFlow Machine Learning Pipeline Using AWS EKS, Prometheus, and Grafana

### Abstract for "Building and Monitoring a Kubeflow Machine Learning Pipeline Using AWS EKS, Prometheus, and Grafana" (Task 2)

This paper serves as a planning document for setting up a machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline using Kubeflow on AWS EKS. It provides a comprehensive proposal that outlines the problem the pipeline aims to solve, the IT solutions proposed, and an implementation plan. The paper discusses the use of Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and data visualization. It lays down the framework for leveraging AWS EKS for Kubernetes orchestration and details the metrics to be captured for evaluating the pipeline's performance. This document is essential for understanding the scope, technical requirements, and steps for building the pipeline.


### Abstract for "Building and Monitoring a Kubeflow Machine Learning Pipeline Using AWS EKS, Prometheus, and Grafana" (Task 3)

This paper is an after-action review of implementing a machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline using Kubeflow on AWS EKS. It assesses the project's execution, capturing what went according to plan and identifying areas for improvement. The paper explores the effectiveness of using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and data visualization, and reviews the project's impact on the existing environment. It also includes a methodology section detailing the approaches taken for implementation and evaluation. This document is crucial for gauging the success of the pipeline and offers insights for future MLOps projects.
